Building the Story\n","Form key messages first and build your story around these core ideas.\n","After defining the outline, insert the data as supporting evidence.\n","This approach makes the story engaging and relevant to the audience.\n","\n","4. Avoid Overloading Visualizations\n","Focus on one idea per visualization to avoid confusion.\n","Example: A cluttered pie chart with too much information makes it hard to determine the key message.\n","Avoid summarizing multiple points in one graph—stick to one idea per visualization for clarity.\n","\n","5. Relevance of Data\n","Filter out irrelevant data:\n","What may seem interesting to a data analyst may not be relevant to the audience.\n","Trying to explain every detail could distract from the key message.\n","Highlight only the data that supports the key findings to keep the presentation clear and concise.\n","\n","6. Conclusion\n","Presenting data-driven findings effectively requires focusing on clarity and engagement.\n","Stick to the key messages, use visuals wisely, and eliminate unnecessary data to ensure a clear and concise presentation."],"metadata":{"id":"fihz8KOVMSDf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **PowerPoint Web**\n","\n","Use Safari or Chrome.
