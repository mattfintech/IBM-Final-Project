# IBM-Final-Project

## 1. **Project Overview**

<h2>The Commercial Space Age</h2>

* Companies are making space travel affordable for everyone.
* Key Companies:
    * Virgin Galactic: Provides suborbital spaceflights.
    * Rocket Lab: Small satellite provider.
    * Blue Origin: Manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets.
    * SpaceX: Leading company with significant accomplishments.

<h2>SpaceX Accomplishments</h2>

* Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station.
* Starlink: Satellite internet constellation providing global satellite Internet access.
* Competitive Advantage: Relatively inexpensive rocket launches due to reusable first stages.
* Falcon 9 Rocket
    * Cost Efficiency
        * Launch Cost: SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches for $62 million compared to $165 million from other providers.
        * Cost Savings: Largely due to the reuse (of the First Stage of launch) which mostly lands back.
        * Stages of Launch: First (larger rocket structure), Second (smaller rs), Fairings.
    * Rocket Structure
        * Payload: Enclosed in fairings.
        * Second Stage: Helps bring the payload to orbit.
    * First Stage:
        * Performs most of the work.
        * Larger and more expensive than the second stage.
        * Can be recovered and reused, unlike other rocket providers.
        * Sometimes crashes or is sacrificed depending on mission parameters.

<h2>Capstone Project Scenario</h2>

* Scenario: Company Space Y (Space X 2), founded by Billionaire Allon Musk (Ellon Musk 2), would like to compete with SpaceX.
* My Job: as Data Scientist;
    * Determine the price of each rocket launch by:
        * Gather information from SpaceX.
        * Create dashboards for my team.
        * Predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage using machine learning models and public data.
